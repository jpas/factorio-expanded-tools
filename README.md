# Expanded Tools

This mod adds 3 more tiers of mining tools to the game whilst keeping game
balance in mind.

These are the new tiers:

1. Jackhammer
    * __Recipe__ 10x Steel plate, 5x Electronic circuit, 1x Engine unit
    * __Required Tech__ Engine
    * __Mining Power__ 6
    * __Durability__ 6000
    * __Damage__ 12 Physical
2. Laser Drill
    * __Recipe__ 10x Steel plate, 5x Advanced circuit, 5x Battery
    * __Required Tech__ Laser
    * __Mining Power__ 10
    * __Durability__ 7000 
    * __Damage__ 20 Laser 
3. Atomic Disassembler
    * __Recipe__ 20x Steel plate, 10x Battery, 5x Processing unit, 10x Alien
      Artifact
    * __Required Tech__ Alien Technology
    * __Mining Power__ 16
    * __Durability__ 8000 
    * __Damage__ 32 Laser

The tiers are determined by comparing the differences between the Iron and 
Steel Axe in the base game. The tier stats are calculated using the following 
factors and are rounded down to the nearest whole number.

* __Durability__ 5000 (Steel) - 4000 (Iron) = 1000, additive scaling
* __Damage__ 8 (Steel) / 5 (Iron) = 1.6, multiplicative scaling
* __Mining Power__ 4 (Steel) / 2.5 (Iron) = 1.6, multiplicative scaling
