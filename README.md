# Expanded Tools

This mod adds 3 more tiers of mining tools to the game. Whilst keeping game
balance in mind.

These are the new tiers:

1. Jackhammer
    * Recipe: 10x Steel plate, 5x Electronic circuit, 1x Engine unit
    * Required Tech: Engine
    * Mining Power: 6
    * Durability: 6000
    * Damage: 12 Physical
2. Laser Drill
    * Recipe: 10x Steel plate, 5x Advanced circuit, 5x Battery
    * Required Tech: Laser
    * Mining Power: 10
    * Durability: 7000 
    * Damage: 20 Laser 
3. Atomic Disassembler
    * Recipe: 20x Steel plate, 10x Battery, 5x Processing unit, 10x Alien
      Artifact
    * Required Tech: Alien Technology
    * Mining Power: 16
    * Durability: 8000 
    * Damage: 32 Laser

The tiers are determined by comparing the differences in the Iron and Steel Axe
in the base game. The tiers stats are calculated using the following and are
rounded down to the nearest whole number.

* Durability: 5000 (Steel) - 4000 (Iron) = 1000, additive scaling
* Damage: 8 (Steel) / 5 (Iron) = 1.6, multiplicative scaling
* Mining Power: 4 (Steel) / 2.5 (Iron) = 1.6, multiplicative scaling
